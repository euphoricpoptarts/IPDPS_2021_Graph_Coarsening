# Code for our IPDPS 2021 Paper

All code relevant to our contributions is located in the cmg subfolder.

Subfolders kokkos and kokkos-kernels are snapshots of the dependencies needed to compile our code.
Each may contain some small modifications we made to enable compilation for Turing GPUs.

See build\_and\_usage\_instructions.txt for detailed info on compiling and using our code.
